                <p> This website is for the audience and viewers of the YouTube channel and streaming channel of WarLeader313, This website will have an easy to operate home menu with 3 different subpage that will explain information about me what I use to make videos and what tech I use to help me in the process of doing that. I will also put the background of how I started to play each game that I will make content for. People will come to this because it is going to come from a solo youtuber and stream just so they can have an easy to navigate place about me as content creator and what my purpose is for making content. I will explain how I got into call of duty modern warfare 3 and why I enjoy playing it. I will explain how I got into playing call of duty black ops 3 zombies with how I enjoy playing it. I will explain how I got into Valorant and why I enjoy playing it. It will also be showing people that think that just starting a game will be easy when it might actually take quite a bit of time. I will add tips that I think might help for people just starting out in a game such as Valorant when switching to a 5v5 tactical shooter. I will have information of how I grew up and spend my time so I can enjoy what matters most to me. I will talk about what I will put first above all else.     </p>
